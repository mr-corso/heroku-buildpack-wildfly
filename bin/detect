    error <<EOF
No WAR files found in 'target' directory for deployment

This buildpack requires *.war files to be existing right under the 'target'
directory, but none could be found there. There can be 2 reasons for this:

  1) You did not add the official Heroku Java Buildpack to your application
     which builds the codebase and produces an output WAR file.
  2) Your Maven build configuration does not specify WAR packaging.

The first issue can be resolved by adding the Heroku Java Buildpack to the
application with these commands:

  heroku buildpacks:clear
  heroku buildpacks:add heroku/java
  heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/mortenterhart/heroku-buildpack-wildfly

The order of the builpacks is important here: First the application is
built using 'heroku/java' and then this buildpack installs a WildFly
instance on top of it.

To get Maven create a WAR file for your application you have to set the
packaging type to 'war' and add the 'maven-war-plugin' as a plugin to your
configuration.

For more information refer to the official usage guide:
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/usage.html
